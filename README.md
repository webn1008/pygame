This is a project I've been doing for practicing and learning python. 
To play the game, you should be able to run it from the console after creating a virtual environment within the folder by typing "python3 -m venv venv" and then run the virtual environment by typying "source venve/bin/activate" minus the quotes of course. You'll know if the virtual environment is running if you see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal text.
The game does require pygame 2.6.1, and the requirements file should already exist when you fork. 
You will need to make sure pygame is installed by typing "python3 -m pygame".
Once these steps are complete you should be able to run the game by typing "python3 main.py" in the terminal.
Current game keys are set as the arrow keys but can be  changed in player.py 
Up = forward
Down = backward
Left = rotate left 
Right = rotate right 
Spacebar = shoot
